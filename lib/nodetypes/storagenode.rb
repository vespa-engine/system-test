  # Wait until Proton has completed all internal bucket move operations, if any.
  #
  # This reduces the time window of where a search node may trigger a distributor to perform ideal
  # state operations that it originally did not know about. For instance, if
  # a search node is doing background indexing it will tell the distributor
  # about buckets when they are indexed. This act might trigger bucket activation
  # which in turn might race with bucket database cross-checking from the
  # system test framework.
  #
  # Note that this is not foolproof; it's still possible to encounter a race
  # with the asynchronous notification from the search node to the distributor
  # after all move operations have been completed. However, as mentioned, this
  # time window should be very limited.
